    description: `Search live listings on secondhand marketplaces by keyword. Marketplaces: ${listMarketplaceNames().join(', ')}. Returns up to \`limit\` listings with id, title, price, location, seller and a thumbnail; call get_listing_details with an id for the description, every photo and shipping. Requirements: Facebook Marketplace needs no credentials but is local, so pass \`location\` as "City, ST"; eBay needs EBAY_CLIENT_ID and EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET in the server environment; Depop and Poshmark need Chrome or Chromium on the machine. Behavior: read-only, no login, no purchases. Facebook may rate-limit repeated searches from one IP, and results for a query are cached for 90 seconds. Errors: a marketplace that fails returns success:false with the reason instead of throwing; an unknown marketplace name lists the valid ones; an empty result usually means the query was too specific, so widen the keywords or drop a price bound before concluding nothing exists. Not for: buying, messaging sellers, saved searches, or new-retail catalogs.`,
